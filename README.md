# ylalz-poc

Follow the [User Guide](https://azure.github.io/Azure-Landing-Zones/accelerator/userguide/)

The infra deployment repository generated by the bootstrap is https://github.com/ClearPointNZ/yialz-mgmt


NOTE:

- Make sure the GitHub account is in correct bill plan. The plan I am using doesn't allow me to create environment protection rule. Therefore I have to diable the feature in Terraform code, which is not ideal.

- The format of platform-landing-zone.tfvars needs more attention. Otherwise the CI pipeline of ylalz-mgmt repository will fail.

- Cannot [disable Azure Monitoring Agent](https://azure.github.io/Azure-Landing-Zones/accelerator/startermodules/terraform-platform-landing-zone/options/ama/) as there is a bug in the Terraform code provided by MS

- `bootstrap_location` and `starter_locations` have to be `australiaeast` not `ae`. The following Azure resources will be created with long name, e.g. rg-management-australiaeast, that is too long.

- `apply_approvers` cannot be empty, however the User Guide this property could.
